            <p>Band of Brothers is a war drama miniseries and was released in 2001. It was based off of Stephen E. Ambroseâ€™s best seller by the same name and produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. This story follows a company of paratroopers during World War II. The company is Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506 Parachute Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army 101st Airborne Division.</p>

            <p>It is heroic and traumatic, it is not turning a blind eye to the people who are fighting and risking their lives for us, it is educational, it is heartbreaking, it is true bonds and brotherhood. Even if you are not interested in war history like myself, I believe everyone should watch this. We all at some point in some way know or are related to a veteran. Seeing the stories of these men will make you appreciate and really think about what they did for our country.       
                These are real heroes.
