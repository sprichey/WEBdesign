            <h2>Treatments</h2>
            <p>In cancer care, different types of doctors—including medical oncologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists—often work together to create an overall treatment plan that may combine different types of treatments to treat the cancer. This is called a multidisciplinary team. Cancer care teams include a variety of other health care professionals, such as palliative care experts, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, oncology nurses, social workers, pharmacists, counselors, dietitians, physical therapists, and others.

                Descriptions of the common types of treatments used for prostate cancer are listed below. Your care plan may also include treatment for symptoms and side effects, an important part of cancer care.
                
                Treatment options and recommendations depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, possible side effects, and the patient’s preferences and overall health.
                
                Cancer treatment can affect older adults in different ways. More information on the specific effects of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy on older patients can be found in this article in another section of this website.
                
                Take time to learn about your treatment options and be sure to ask questions if something is unclear. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment, the likelihood that the treatment will work, what you can expect while receiving the treatment, and the possible urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormone-related side effects of treatment. Discuss with your doctor how the treatment options may affect recurrence, survival, and quality of life. In addition, it is important to discuss your doctor's experience with treating prostate cancer. These types of talks are called "shared decision making." Shared decision making is when you and your doctors work together to choose treatments that fit the goals of your care. Shared decision making is particularly important for prostate cancer because there are different treatment options. Learn more about making treatment decisions.
                
                Because most prostate cancers are found in the early stages when they are growing slowly, you usually do not have to rush to make treatment decisions. During this time, it is important to talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of all your treatment options and when treatment should begin. This discussion should also address the current state of the cancer, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Whether you have symptoms or PSA levels are rising rapidly</li>
                    <li>Whether the cancer has spread to the bones</li>
                    <li>Your health history</li>
                    <li>Your quality of life</li>
                    <li>Your current urinary and sexual function</li>
                    <li>Any other medical conditions you may have</li>
                </ul>
