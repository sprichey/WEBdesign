            <h2>Treatments</h2>
            <p>In cancer care, different types of doctors—including medical oncologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists—often work together to create an overall treatment plan that may combine different types of treatments to treat the cancer. This is called a multidisciplinary team. Cancer care teams include a variety of other health care professionals, such as palliative care experts, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, oncology nurses, social workers, pharmacists, counselors, dietitians, physical therapists, and others.

                Descriptions of the common types of treatments used for prostate cancer are listed below. Your care plan may also include treatment for symptoms and side effects, an important part of cancer care.
                
                Treatment options and recommendations depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, possible side effects, and the patient’s preferences and overall health.
                
                Cancer treatment can affect older adults in different ways. More information on the specific effects of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy on older patients can be found in this article in another section of this website.
                
                Take time to learn about your treatment options and be sure to ask questions if something is unclear. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment, the likelihood that the treatment will work, what you can expect while receiving the treatment, and the possible urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormone-related side effects of treatment. Discuss with your doctor how the treatment options may affect recurrence, survival, and quality of life. In addition, it is important to discuss your doctor's experience with treating prostate cancer. These types of talks are called "shared decision making." Shared decision making is when you and your doctors work together to choose treatments that fit the goals of your care. Shared decision making is particularly important for prostate cancer because there are different treatment options. Learn more about making treatment decisions.
                
                Because most prostate cancers are found in the early stages when they are growing slowly, you usually do not have to rush to make treatment decisions. During this time, it is important to talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of all your treatment options and when treatment should begin. This discussion should also address the current state of the cancer, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Whether you have symptoms or PSA levels are rising rapidly</li>
                    <li>Whether the cancer has spread to the bones</li>
                    <li>Your health history</li>
                    <li>Your quality of life</li>
                    <li>Your current urinary and sexual function</li>
                    <li>Any other medical conditions you may have</li>
                </ul>
            
        </section>

             <h2>List of treatments</h2>
        <div id="accordion">
            
            <h3>Active Surveillance</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Active surveillance and watchful waiting
                    If prostate cancer is in an early stage, is growing slowly, and treating the cancer would cause more problems than the disease itself, a doctor may recommend active surveillance or watchful waiting.
                    
                    Active surveillance. Prostate cancer treatments may seriously affect a person's quality of life. These treatments can cause side effects, such as erectile dysfunction, which is when someone is unable to get and maintain an erection, and incontinence, which is when a person cannot control their urine flow or bowel function. In addition, many prostate cancers grow slowly and cause no symptoms or problems. For this reason, many people may consider delaying cancer treatment rather than starting treatment right away. This is called active surveillance. During active surveillance, the cancer is closely monitored for signs that it is worsening. If the cancer is found to be worsening, treatment will begin.
                    
                    Active surveillance is usually preferred for those with very-low-risk and low-risk prostate cancer that can be treated with surgery or radiation therapy if it shows signs of getting worse. ASCO endorses recommendations from CancerCare Ontario on active surveillance, which recommend active surveillance for most patients with cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate, with a Gleason score of 6 or below. Sometimes, active surveillance may be an option for prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 7. There is also growing use of genomic testing to help find out if active surveillance is the best choice for a person with prostate cancer 
                    
                    ASCO encourages the following testing schedule for active surveillance:
                    
                    A PSA test every 3 to 6 months
                    
                    A DRE at least once every year
                    
                    Another prostate biopsy within 6 to 12 months, then a biopsy at least every 2 to 5 years
                    
                    Treatment should begin if the results of the tests done during active surveillance show signs of the cancer becoming more aggressive or spreading, if the cancer causes pain, or if the cancer blocks the urinary tract.
                    
                    Watchful waiting. Watchful waiting may be an option for older adults and those with other serious or life-threatening illnesses who are expected to live less than 5 years. With watchful waiting, routine PSA tests, DRE, and biopsies are not usually done. If the prostate cancer causes symptoms, such as pain or blockage of the urinary tract, then treatment may be recommended to relieve those symptoms. This may include hormonal therapy (see “Systemic treatments” below). Patients who start on active surveillance who later have a shorter life expectancy may switch to watchful waiting at some point to avoid repeated tests and biopsies.
                    
                    Doctors must collect as much information as possible about the patient’s other illnesses and life expectancy to determine whether active surveillance or watchful waiting is appropriate for each person. In addition, many doctors recommend a repeat biopsy shortly after diagnosis to confirm that the cancer is in an early stage and growing slowly before considering active surveillance for someone who is otherwise healthy. New information is becoming available all the time, and it is important to discuss these issues with the doctor to make the best decisions about treatment. Learn more about ASCO’s endorsement of recommendations for active surveillance on a separate ASCO website.</p>

            <h3>Local Treatments</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Local treatments get rid of cancer from a specific, limited area of the body. Such treatments include surgery and radiation therapy. For early-stage prostate cancer, local treatments may get rid of the cancer completely. If the cancer has spread outside the prostate gland, other types of treatment called systemic treatments (see “Systemic treatments,” below) may be needed to destroy cancer cells located in other parts of the body.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Surgery</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Surgery involves the removal of the prostate and some surrounding lymph nodes during an operation. A surgical oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancer using surgery. For prostate cancer, a urologist or urologic oncologist is the surgical oncologist involved in treatment. The type of surgery depends on the stage of the disease, the patient’s overall health, and other factors.

                    Radical (open) prostatectomy. A radical prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the entire prostate and the seminal vesicles. Lymph nodes in the pelvic area may also be removed. This operation has the risk of affecting sexual function. Nerve-sparing surgery, when possible, increases the chance that a man can maintain his sexual function after surgery by avoiding surgical damage to the nerves that allow erections and orgasm to occur. Orgasm can occur even if some nerves are cut because these are separate processes. Urinary incontinence is also a possible side effect of radical prostatectomy. To help resume normal sexual function, drugs, penile implants, or injections may be recommended. Sometimes, another surgery can fix urinary incontinence.
                    
                    Robotic or laparoscopic prostatectomy. This type of surgery is less invasive than a radical prostatectomy and may shorten recovery time. A camera and instruments are inserted through small keyhole incisions in the patient’s abdomen. The surgeon then directs the robotic instruments to remove the prostate gland. In general, robotic prostatectomy causes less bleeding and less pain, but the sexual and urinary side effects are similar to those of a radical (open) prostatectomy. Talk with your doctor about whether your treatment center offers this procedure and how it compares with the results of the radical (open) prostatectomy.
                    
                    Bilateral orchiectomy. Bilateral orchiectomy is the surgical removal of both testicles. It is described in detail in “Systemic treatments” below.
                    
                    Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). TURP is most often used to relieve symptoms of a urinary blockage, not to treat prostate cancer. In this procedure, with the patient under full anesthesia, which is medication to block the awareness of pain, a surgeon inserts a narrow tube with a cutting device called a cystoscope into the urethra and then into the prostate to remove prostate tissue.
                    
                    Before surgery, talk with your health care team about the possible side effects from the specific surgery you will have. Typically, younger or healthier patients may benefit more from a prostatectomy. Younger patients are also less likely to develop permanent erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence after a prostatectomy than older patients. Learn more about coping with the sexual side effects of prostate cancer in the Coping With Treatment section.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. A doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer is called a radiation oncologist. A radiation therapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time.

                    External-beam radiation therapy. External-beam radiation therapy is the most common type of radiation treatment. The radiation oncologist uses a machine located outside the body to focus a beam of x-rays on the area with the cancer.
                    
                    One method of external-beam radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer is called hypofractionated radiation therapy. This is when a person receives a higher daily dose of radiation therapy given over a shorter period, instead of lower doses given over a longer period. Extreme hypofraction radiation therapy is when the entire treatment is delivered in 5 or fewer treatments. This is also called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR).
                    
                    According to recommendations from ASCO, the American Society for Radiation Oncology, and the American Urological Association, hypofractionated radiation therapy may be an option for the following people with early-stage prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body:
                    
                    People with low-risk prostate cancer who need or prefer treatment instead of active surveillance.
                    
                    People with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer receiving external-beam radiation therapy to the prostate but not to the pelvic lymph nodes.
                    
                    People who receive hypofractionated radiation therapy may have a slightly higher risk of some short-term side effects after treatment compared with those who receive regular external-beam radiation therapy. This may include gastrointestinal side effects. Based on current research, people who receive hypofractionated radiation therapy are not at a higher risk of side effects in the long term. Talk with your health care team if you have questions about your risk for side effects.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Brachytherapy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Brachytherapy. Brachytherapy, or internal radiation therapy, is the insertion of radioactive sources directly into the prostate. These sources, called seeds, give off radiation just around the area where they are inserted and may be left for a short time (high-dose rate) or for a longer time (low-dose rate). Low-dose-rate seeds are left in the prostate permanently and work for up to 1 year after they are inserted. However, how long they work depends on the source of radiation. High-dose-rate brachytherapy is usually left in the body for less than 30 minutes, but it may need to be given more than once.

                    Brachytherapy may be used with other treatments, such as external-beam radiation therapy and/or hormonal therapy. ASCO recommends the following brachytherapy options:
                    
                    People with low-risk prostate cancer who need or choose an active treatment may consider low-dose-rate brachytherapy. Other options include external-beam radiation therapy or a radical prostatectomy.
                    
                    People with intermediate-risk prostate cancer who choose external-beam radiation therapy (with or without hormonal therapy) should be offered either a low-dose-rate or high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost in addition to the external-beam radiation therapy. For a brachytherapy boost, a lower dose of radiation is given for a shorter period of time. Some patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer may be able to receive only brachytherapy without external-beam radiation therapy or hormonal therapy.
                    
                    Patients with high-risk prostate cancer who are receiving external-beam radiation therapy and hormonal therapy should be offered a low-dose-rate or high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). IMRT is a type of external-beam radiation therapy that uses CT scans to form a 3D picture of the prostate before treatment. A computer uses this information about the size, shape, and location of the prostate cancer to determine how much radiation is needed to destroy it. With IMRT, high doses of radiation can be directed at the prostate without increasing the risk of damaging nearby organs.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Proton Therapy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Proton therapy. Proton therapy, also called proton beam therapy, is a type of external-beam radiation therapy that uses protons rather than x-rays. At high energy, protons can destroy cancer cells. Current research has not shown that proton therapy provides any more benefit to people with prostate cancer than traditional radiation therapy. It can also be more expensive.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Focal Therapies</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Focal therapies are less-invasive treatments that destroy small prostate tumors without treating the rest of the prostate gland. These treatments use heat, cold, and other methods to treat cancer, mostly for low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Focal therapies are being studied in clinical trials. Most have not been approved as standard treatment options.

                    Cryosurgery, also called cryotherapy or cryoablation, involves freezing cancer cells with a metal probe inserted through a small incision in the area between the rectum and the scrotum, the skin sac that contains the testicles. It is not an established therapy or standard of care to treat newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Cryosurgery has not been compared with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, so doctors do not know if it is a comparable treatment option. Its effects on urinary and sexual function are also not well known.
                    
                    High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a heat-based type of focal therapy. During HIFU treatment, an ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum and then sound waves are directed at cancerous parts of the prostate gland. This treatment is designed to destroy cancer cells while limiting damage to the rest of the prostate gland. The FDA approved HIFU for the treatment of prostate tissue in 2015. HIFU may be an attractive option for some people, but knowing who may benefit most from this treatment is still unknown. HIFU should only be performed by a specialist with a lot of expertise. You will need to carefully discuss with your doctor if HIFU is the best treatment for you.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Systemic Treatments</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Systemic therapy is the use of medication to destroy cancer cells. Systemic therapies are generally prescribed by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with medication.

                    Common ways to give systemic therapies include an intravenous (IV) tube placed into a vein using a needle or in a pill or capsule that is swallowed (orally).
                    
                    The types of systemic therapies used for prostate cancer include:
                    
                    Hormonal therapy
                    
                    Targeted therapy
                    
                    Chemotherapy
                    
                    Immunotherapy
                    
                    Radiopharmaceuticals
                    
                    Bone-modifying drugs
                    
                    Each of these types of therapies is discussed below in more detail. A person may receive 1 type of systemic therapy at a time or a combination of systemic therapies given at the same time. They can also be given as part of a treatment plan that includes surgery and/or radiation therapy.
                    
                    The medications used to treat cancer are continually being evaluated. Talking with your doctor is often the best way to learn about the medications prescribed for you, their purpose, and their potential side effects or interactions with other medications. It is also important to let your doctor know if you are taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications or supplements. Herbs, supplements, and other drugs can interact with cancer medications.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Hormonal Therapy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Because prostate cancer growth is driven by male sex hormones called androgens, lowering levels of these hormones can help slow the growth of the cancer. The most common androgen is testosterone. Hormonal therapy is used to lower testosterone levels in the body, either by surgically removing the testicles, known as surgical castration, or by taking drugs that turn off the function of the testicles, called medical castration. Which hormonal therapy is used is less important than the main goal of lowering testosterone levels. This treatment can be referred to with other names, including androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).

                    Another way to stop testosterone from driving the growth of prostate cancer is to treat it with a type of medication called an androgen axis inhibitor. These medications can stop the body from making testosterone or stop testosterone from working. Androgen axis inhibitors include androgen receptor inhibitors and androgen synthesis inhibitors, which are both described in more detail below.
                    
                    Treatment with hormonal therapy is used to treat prostate cancer in many different situations, including localized, locally advanced, and metastatic prostate cancer, as well as rising PSA level after surgery and/or radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. Some of the situations in which this therapy may be used include:
                    
                    People with NCCN-based intermediate-risk and high-risk, localized prostate cancer who are having definitive therapy with radiation therapy are candidates for hormonal therapy. Definitive therapy is a treatment given with the intent to cure the cancer. People with intermediate-risk prostate cancer should receive hormonal therapy for at least 4 to 6 months. Those with high-risk prostate cancer should receive it for 24 to 36 months.
                    
                    Hormonal therapy may also be given to those who have had surgery and microscopic cancer cells were found in the removed lymph nodes. It is done to eliminate any remaining cancer cells and reduce the chance the cancer will return. This is known as adjuvant therapy. Although the use of adjuvant hormonal therapy is controversial, some specific patients appear to benefit from this approach.</p>
            </div>


            <h3>Types of Hormonal Therapy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Bilateral orchiectomy. Bilateral orchiectomy is the surgical removal of both testicles. It was the first treatment used for metastatic prostate cancer more than 70 years ago. Even though this is a surgical procedure, it is considered hormonal therapy because it removes the main source of testosterone production, the testicles. The effects of this surgery are permanent and cannot be reversed. Bilateral orchiectomy is not commonly used in practice.

                    LHRH agonists. LHRH stands for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. Medications known as LHRH agonists prevent the testicles from receiving messages sent by the body to make testosterone. By blocking these signals, LHRH agonists reduce a man’s testosterone level just as well as removing his testicles. Unlike orchiectomy, the effects of LHRH agonists are often reversible, so testosterone production usually begins again once treatment stops. However, testosterone recovery can take from 6 months to 24 months, and for a small number of patients, testosterone production does not return.
                    
                    LHRH agonists are injected or placed as small implants under the skin. Depending on the drug used, they may be given once a month or once a year. When LHRH agonists are first given, testosterone levels briefly increase before falling to very low levels. This effect is known as a “flare.” Flares occur because the testicles temporarily release more testosterone in response to the way LHRH agonists work in the body. This flare may increase the activity of prostate cancer cells and cause symptoms and side effects, such as bone pain if the cancer has spread to the bone.
                    
                    LHRH antagonist. This class of drugs, also called a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, stops the testicles from producing testosterone like LHRH agonists, but they reduce testosterone levels more quickly and do not cause the flare associated with LHRH agonists. The FDA has approved degarelix (Firmagon), given by monthly injection, to treat advanced prostate cancer. One side effect of this drug is that it may cause a severe allergic reaction. An oral LHRH antagonist, relugolix (Orgovyx), is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix is different from other LHRH antagonists in 2 ways. First, it has a lower risk of causing serious heart problems in patients with preexisting heart disease. Second, when treatment with relugolix is stopped, testosterone production is restored within weeks, rather than months, which may be helpful for those undergoing intermittent hormonal therapy (see below).
                    
                    Androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors. While LHRH agonists and antagonists lower testosterone levels in the blood, androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors block testosterone from binding to so-called “androgen receptors,” which are chemical structures in cancer cells that allow testosterone and other male hormones to enter the cells. In effect, AR inhibitors stop testosterone from working. Older AR inhibitors include bicalutamide (Casodex), flutamide (available as a generic drug), and nilutamide (Nilandron) and are taken as pills. Newer AR inhibitors include apalutamide (Erleada), darolutamide (Nubeqa), and enzalutamide (Xtandi).
                    
                    These medications are also sometimes called anti-androgens. AR inhibitors are usually given to people who have “castration-sensitive” prostate cancer, which means that the prostate cancer still responds to treatments that lower testosterone levels. AR inhibitors are not usually used by themselves to treat prostate cancer.
                    
                    Apalutamide. Apalutamide is approved by the FDA for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer in combination with hormonal therapy.
                    
                    Darolutamide. Darolutamide is approved for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
                    
                    Enzalutamide. Enzalutamide is a nonsteroidal AR inhibitor that is approved to treat metastatic and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer as well as metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.
                    
                    Androgen synthesis inhibitors. Although the testicles produce most of the body's testosterone, other cells in the body can still make small amounts of the hormone that may drive cancer growth. These include the adrenal glands and some prostate cancer cells. Androgen synthesis inhibitors target an enzyme called CYP17 and stop cells from making testosterone.
                    
                    Abiraterone acetate (Zytiga). Abiraterone acetate is taken in the form of a pill. Patients take 4 pills per day along with prednisone (multiple brand names) or prednisolone (multiple brand names) twice a day. Prednisone or prednisolone helps prevent some of the side effects of abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate may cause serious side effects, such as high blood pressure, low blood potassium levels, fatigue, and fluid retention. Common side effects include weakness, joint swelling or pain, swelling in the legs or feet, hot flushes, diarrhea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and anemia.
                    
                    Ketoconazole (Nizoral). Ketoconazole is an androgen synthesis inhibitor that is no longer widely used because of multiple drug interactions. However, ketoconazole may be an option for some patients.
                    
                    Combined androgen blockade. Sometimes androgen receptor inhibitors are combined with bilateral orchiectomy or LHRH agonist treatment to maximize the blockade of male hormones or to prevent the flare associated with treatment with LHRH agonists.
                    
                    Intermittent hormonal therapy. Traditionally, hormonal therapy was given for the patient’s lifetime. During the past 2 decades, researchers have studied the use of intermittent hormonal therapy, which is when therapy is given for specific times (most commonly 6 months) and then stopped temporarily to allow for testosterone levels to recover. For these patients, hormonal therapy is restarted when the PSA begins to rise again. When to restart therapy (that is, at which PSA levels) is still a topic of debate. Using hormonal therapy in this way may lower the side effects related to the lack of testosterone and improve a person’s quality of life. ASCO recommends this approach only for people with high-risk PSA recurrence (see below) and with no evidence of metastatic disease after radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy. However, intermittent hormonal therapy has not been studied with newer hormonal treatments, such as abiraterone or enzalutamide, or chemotherapy, so ASCO cannot recommend intermittent hormonal therapy with them.</p>

            <h3>Targeted Therapy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets the cancer’s specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival. This type of treatment blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells and limits damage to healthy cells.

                    Not all tumors have the same targets. To find the most effective treatment, your doctor may run tests to identify the genes, proteins, and other factors in your tumor. This helps doctors better match each patient with the most effective treatment whenever possible. In addition, research studies continue to find out more about specific molecular targets and new treatments directed at them. Learn more about the basics of targeted treatments.
                    
                    Targeted therapy for prostate cancer includes:
                    
                    Olaparib (Lynparza). Olaparib is a type of targeted therapy called a PARP inhibitor. It is approved for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease has continued to grow and spread during treatment with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and who have DNA-repair gene defects, which may be inherited or in the tumor. DNA-repair gene defects make it harder for cancer cells to repair damaged DNA. Certain genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and several others, are linked with DNA-repair gene defects, and the presence of any of these can allow treatment with olaparib. The FDA has also approved 2 specific tests to select patients for treatment with olaparib.
                    
                    Rucaparib (Rubraca). Rucaparib is another PARP inhibitor approved to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in patients whose disease has not been stopped by treatment with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and chemotherapy, and who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation that is either inherited or in the tumor.
                    
                    One or more tests must be given to determine whether a patient may receive olaparib or rucaparib:
                    
                    Testing for germline mutation after discussion with a genetic counselor
                    
                    Genomic sequencing of tumor tissue
                    
                    Genomic sequencing of the tumor DNA floating in the bloodstream
                    
                    Genomic sequencing may be performed on tissue that was previously collected or on tissue from a new biopsy. Germline mutation testing alone identifies about half of the patients eligible for this treatment. People with metastatic prostate cancer who are considering targeted therapy are encouraged to talk with their doctors about all 3 tests mentioned above.
                    
                    Talk with your doctor about possible side effects for a specific medication and how they can be managed.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells, usually by keeping the cancer cells from growing, dividing, and making more cells.

                    Chemotherapy may help those with advanced or castration-resistant prostate cancer and those with newly diagnosed or castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. A chemotherapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of cycles given over a set period of time.
                    
                    There are several standard drugs used for prostate cancer. In general, standard chemotherapy begins with docetaxel (Taxotere) combined with prednisone.
                    
                    Recent research shows adding docetaxel to hormonal therapy in those with newly diagnosed or castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer significantly helps people live longer and stops the disease from growing and spreading.
                    
                    Cabazitaxel (Jevtana) is approved to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that has been previously treated with docetaxel. It is a microtubule inhibitor.
                    
                    The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the individual, the type of chemotherapy received, the dose used, and the length of treatment, but they can include fatigue, sores in the mouth and throat, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, constipation, blood disorders, nervous system effects, changes in thinking and memory, sexual and reproductive issues, appetite loss, pain, and hair loss. The side effects of chemotherapy usually go away after treatment has finished. However, some side effects may continue, come back, or develop later. Ask your doctor which side effects you may experience, based on your treatment plan. Your health care team will work with you to manage or prevent many of these side effects.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Immunotherapy</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Immunotherapy, also called biologic therapy, is designed to boost the body's natural defenses to fight the cancer. It uses materials made either by the body or in a laboratory to improve, target, or restore immune system function.

                    For some people with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer who have no or very few cancer symptoms and generally have not had chemotherapy, vaccine therapy with sipuleucel-T (Provenge) may be an option.
                    
                    Sipuleucel-T is adapted for each patient. Before treatment, blood is removed from the patient in a process called leukapheresis. Special immune cells are separated from the patient’s blood, modified in the laboratory, and then put back into the patient. At this point, the patient’s immune system may recognize and destroy prostate cancer cells. When this treatment is used, it is difficult to know if the treatment is working to treat the cancer because treatment with sipuleucel-T does not lead to lower PSA levels, shrinking of the tumor, or keeping the cancer from getting worse. However, results from clinical trials have shown that treatment with sipuleucel-T can lengthen lives by about 4 months in people with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with few or no symptoms.
                    
                    Different types of immunotherapy can cause different side effects. Common side effects include skin reactions, flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, and weight changes. Talk with your doctor about possible side effects for the immunotherapy recommended for you.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Radiation Therapy by Infusion</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Radium-223 (Xofigo) is a radioactive substance used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. Radium-223 is an alpha-emitter radionucleotide that mimics calcium and targets areas in the bone where the cancer is causing changes. This treatment delivers radiation particles directly to tumors found in the bone, limiting damage to healthy tissue, including the bone marrow, where normal blood cells are made. Radium-223 is given by intravenous injection (IV) once a month for 6 months. This treatment is given by a radiation oncologist or a nuclear medicine doctor. Your medical oncologist should continue to follow your progress during this treatment to make sure the treatment is helping and that any potential side effects are managed. Treatment with radium-233 does not dependably lower PSA, so patients should not expect to see big decreases in PSA levels during treatment and, in fact, often PSA levels may rise.

                    Some people should not receive this treatment, especially those who have prostate cancer that has spread to the liver and/or lungs and/or those with enlarged lymph nodes (3 or more cm in diameter). Radium-223 should not be used in combination with abiraterone and prednisone because that combination increases the risk of bone fractures. Discuss with your doctor whether this medication is an option for you.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Bone-Modifying Drugs</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Bone health is an important issue in the lives of people with prostate cancer. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are bone conditions that can be caused or worsened by hormonal therapy (see “Systemic therapies,” above). Patients receiving hormonal therapy for non-metastatic prostate cancer should be evaluated for risk of fractures. The most common way to find a person’s risk is with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure the strength of the bones. Patients who are found to be at high risk for a fracture should receive treatment to lower the risk. Bone-modifying drugs that can be used in this situation include denosumab (Prolia), zoledronic acid (Reclast), alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), ibandronate (Boniva), and pamidronate (Aredia). These medications can have side effects, so talk with your doctor about when to take the medication and which would be best based on your situation.

                    Bone-modifying drugs have not been shown to prevent the spread of prostate cancer to the bone in patients who do not currently have evidence of bone metastases.
                    
                    In patients with prostate cancer that has spread to the bone, there is always some risk of bone problems, such as fracture, pain, and spinal cord compression. These are called “skeletal-related events.” When prostate cancer has spread to bone and has also become resistant to standard hormonal therapy (this is called metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, see below), bone-modifying drugs may be recommended to reduce the risk of these problems. Specifically, denosumab (Xgeva) or zoledronic acid (Zometa) can be given once per month to reduce that risk.
                    
                    A rare but serious possible side effect of bone-modifying drugs is osteonecrosis of the jaw. The symptoms of osteonecrosis of the jaw include pain, swelling, and infection of the jaw; loose teeth; and exposed bone. The most prominent risk factor for this side effect is the need for invasive dental work (for example, tooth extraction) in a person who is already receiving a potent bone-modifying drug such as denosumab or zoledronic acid. It is important to have a dental evaluation before starting these drugs in order to assess safety and address problem areas before starting a bone-modifying drug. If someone taking these drugs needs dental work, treatment should be stopped until the dental work is completed and the patient has healed.</p>
