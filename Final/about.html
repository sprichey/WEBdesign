           <p>A cancer in a man's prostate, a small walnut-sized gland that produces seminal fluid.
            A man's prostate produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm.
            Symptoms include difficulty with urination, but sometimes there are no symptoms at all.
            Some types of prostate cancer grow slowly. In some of these cases, monitoring is recommended. Other types are aggressive and require radiation, surgery, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or other treatments.</p>

                  <p> Cancer in this early stage is usually slow growing. The tumor cannot be felt and involves one-half of 1 side of the prostate or even less than that. PSA levels are low. The cancer cells look like healthy cells.

                 <p>The tumor cannot be felt and involves half of 1 side of the prostate or even less than that. PSA levels are medium, and the cancer cells are well differentiated.
