        <h2>Elephants</h2>

        <p>There are three species of elephants. First there is the Asian elephant found in India and Southeast Asia. An adult male can weigh up to 8,800 pounds and stand 9 feet tall at the shoulder. An adult female can weigh up to 6,000 and stand 7.9 feet tall at the shoulder. The average life span for the Asian elephant is said to be around 40-50 years. These elephants are endangered to do mass decline mainly between 1970-1980 from being killed for their ivory. Today the greatest threat is losing their habitats of forest and grasslands due to human population increaseing and taking over the elephants homes.
