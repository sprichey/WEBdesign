                  <p>
                    The domestic dog is a domesticated form of wolf. The dog descended from an ancient, extinct wolf, with the modern grey wolf being the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.

                    For the past 25 years, the American Kennel Club (AKC) has named the Labrador Retriever the number one dog breed in America (www.akc.org/news/the-most-popular-dog-breeds-in-america/). But for the first time in quite a while, there may be a real “bully” battling for the top spot. The Bulldog and French Bulldog have been gaining tremendous popularity, and may have the best chance yet to become America’s next top dog breed.

                <h3>Section 3</h3>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    #1: Labrador Retriever
                    The Lab makes his 25th straight appearance as the number one breed. And why not? This family-friendly, smart, and fun-loving breed is a favorite in households across America. Their desire to please and gentle disposition also help them excel as guide dogs and search-and-rescue dogs.
                    
                    #2: German Shepherd Dog
                    A true dog lover’s pet, the German Shepherd Dog is intelligent and hardworking. They are also known to be extremely versatile and courageous. No wonder they are so often trained to assist people with disabilities, the police, the military, and other service organizations.
                    
                    #3: Golden Retriever
                    A very athletic breed, the Golden Retriever is another family-friendly pet with a fantastic demeanor. Because they love to run and play, they’re a great fit for families with young children. Also skilled workers, Goldens are popular hunting companions, guide dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs.
                    
                    #4: Bulldog
                    One of the fastest-growing breeds in terms of popularity, Bulldogs are fun and loveable. They are very calm when compared with the previously mentioned breeds, and they make great companions. They don’t need a ton of exercise—they actually prefer to stay home and relax most of the time.
                    
                    #5: Beagle
                    Conveniently sized with short, low-maintenance coats, the Beagle is a peaceful and cheerful pet. Unlike Bulldogs, Beagles do require some exercise, so a fenced-in yard is an ideal setting for them. A hunting breed with great curiosity, these hounds enjoy exploring and keeping their noses active.

                  <p>
                    #6: French Bulldog
                    French Bulldogs have mixed demeanors—sometimes they love to run and play, and sometimes they just want to lie around and be loved. They thrive from human contact and attention, so this isn’t a breed to be kept alone for hours at a time.
                    
                    #7: Yorkshire Terrier
                    “Yorkies” are the most popular small dog breed in America. They become extremely devoted to their owners, and their small stature makes them a great choice for people who live in condos or apartments. They can be a bit feisty at times, but overall this brave and energetic breed is excellent for anyone wanting a small companion.
                    
                    #8: Poodle
                    Poodles are known for making regular appearances in dog shows. Their elegant form never goes unnoticed, but their personalities are just as charming as their looks. They’re smart, easy to train, eager to please, and lots of fun to be around.
                    
                    #9: Rottweiler
                    Large and powerful, Rottweilers are sometimes misunderstood because of their stature. They are actually very intelligent, easily trained, and willing to work. Their broad chests and muscular bodies stand out, but Rottweilers have even bigger hearts and make for devoted companions.
                    
                    #10: Boxer
                    Boxers have endless energy and love to play. Although they can be headstrong at times, Boxers are extremely loyal to their owners. They are great with kids while also being alert and courageous.

                  <p>Number one on this list is the Bernese Mountain Dog. The Bernese Mountain Dog or Berner Sennenhund is a large German dog breed that originates from the Swiss Alps; the breed was established in 1912. They were originally a cross from a Mastiff and hound dog and worked on farms.</p>

                  <p>"Ancient breed" is a term formerly, but no longer, used for a particular group of dog breeds by the American Kennel Club.[11][18] These breeds were referred to as "ancient", as opposed to modern, breeds because historically it was believed their origins dated back more than 500 years.

                  In 2004, a study looked at the microsatellites of 414 purebred dogs representing 85 breeds. The study found that dog breeds were so genetically distinct that 99% of individual dogs could be correctly assigned to their breed based on their genotype, indicating that breeding barriers (pure-bred breeding) have led to distinct genetic units. The study identified 9 breeds that could be represented on the branches of a phylogenetic tree which grouped together with strong statistical support and could be separated from the other breeds with a modern European origin. These 9 breeds had been referred to as "ancient breeds". The study found that the Pharaoh Hound and Ibizan Hound were not as old as once believed; rather, they had been recreated from combinations of other breeds, and that the Norwegian Elkhound grouped with the other European dogs despite reports of direct Scandinavian origins dating back 5,000 years.</p>
