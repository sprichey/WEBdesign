        <h3>Why I perfer playing a warlock</h3>
        <h6>These statemnets are only my personal opinion</h6>
        <p>World of Warcraft is my favorite game because you never run out of things to do. When you get bored with what you are doing there is always many other things to do. I also like that there are so many character options, which you can have mupltile characters.</p>

        <p>I perfer playing a warlock because I like playing ranged damage. With a warlock you also have a minion to help you. Another good thing is that if you are low on life while fighting you can siphen the life of the enemy you are fighting.</p>
