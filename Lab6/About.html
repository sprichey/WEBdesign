          <p>
            Their journey together begins with their training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia under an extremely strict Captain Sobel before their journey to Normandy. The company is brought into the war in Normandy but after missing their drop zone they are scattered across the region. This is when the main character of the story Dick Winters takes command of the company due to their company commander being killed from a direct hit to his plane before he could make the jump. They fight in the Battle of Carentan and the Battle of Bloody Gulch with many lives lost. This episode has an inaccurate statement at the end that Private Albert Blithe died from a gun shot wound to the neck on patrol. Blithe actually recovered from his wounds and continued to serve in the Army as an active-duty serviceman until his death in Germany December 17, 1967 with a rank of Master Sergeant from a perforated ulcer. As the Battle of the Bulge begins Easy Company is called to Bastogne and Winters who is now a captain takes command of the whole battalion. They become dangerously low on supplies and a good bit of focus is shifted to the company medic Eugene “DOC” Roe. Doc struggles to find much needed supplies for the wounded as he scrambles from soldier to soldier. The company comes across concentration camps near Landsberg. They free what surviving prisoners they find and confront the local Germanys which deny the claims that they knew about the camp and what was going on. The American soldiers occupying the area, knowing the locals were lying, forced the locals to clean up the concentration camp which included the bodies of the dead prisoners. Easy Company is responsible for the capture if Hitler’s Eagle’s Nest in Berchtesgaden before heading to Austria.
