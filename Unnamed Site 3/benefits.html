        <div class="card-body">There are not enough homes for all the animals that are born every year. Adopting from a shelter helps weaken the pet overpopulation cycle. Each year 8 to 12 million dogs, cats, puppies and kittens are euthanized because there are simply not enough homes for them.</div>

        <div class="card-body">Throughout the country, thousands of commercial pet-breeding facilities and backyard breeders produce millions of animals for sale in pet stores and through newspaper ads. Often known as puppy and kitten mills, these facilities repeatedly impregnate female dogs that spend their entire lives in cages without human companionship. These unfortunate animals are often in intolerable environments, forced to produce litter upon litter, and are destroyed after they become unprofitable assets. Adopting a shelter animal means you don’t support such cruel practices.</div>

            <div class="card-body">Adult pets are great! Often they are already housetrained and some can even “sit” or “stay.” You won’t have to deal with the “puppy phase” or the “kitten phase” which means less of that youthful energy such as biting, chewing, clawing, etc. You will be able to see the personality of the adult animal and won’t have to wait to see what you get.</div>

            <div class="card-body">Sadly, every community in America requires an animal shelter. When you adopt a pet from our shelter, you assist a not-for-profit organization, but also send a message to others who will be asking you for years to come where you obtained your adorable pet. Shelters improve the community by mandating that adopted animals be spayed or neutered. This requirement diminishes chances that more unwanted animals will enter the world.</div>

            <div class="card-body">Lots of adult dogs have been through the potty-training process, so they already know not to do their business in the house. That said, any dog dealing with a new living situation might be prone to accidents while they get their bearings, but at least adult dogs are physically capable of going a few hours between potty breaks; the Humane Society says that puppies can typically only be expected to wait an hour for every month of their age, so a six-month-old pup will definitely require nighttime outings.</div>

            <div class="card-body">If you have your heart set on bringing a specific breed of dog into your life, you can still start by checking local shelters. “In my ten years of experience, I’ve seen full-blooded bulldogs, Chihuahuas, and Labradoodles available for adoption!” Chavarria says. If you don’t find what you’re looking for, check out breed-specific rescue operations—the American Kennel Club’s website has links and contacts for organizations that re-home dogs from Affenpinschers to Yorkies.</div>

                <div class="card-body">If you really want to bring home a youngster so you can play a strong role in socializing and training it early on and get all those warm cuddles, you can still adopt. Chavarria says her shelter gets “oops” puppies from unspayed female dogs: “We see a lot of pregnant mother dogs or nursing moms that enter our adoption center.” Chavarria adds that the Nashville Humane Association has foster teams that take care of the puppies and mama dogs until they’re healthy and old enough to go out to adoptive families. Berliner confirms that puppies are often available for adoption. “It sometimes takes a little time and patience to find the one for your family, but shelters are a great place to get a new puppy,” she says.</div>

                <div class="card-body">On the other end of the spectrum, if you’re looking for a companion who doesn’t need intensive exercise sessions, you might want to consider adopting a senior citizen. Berliner says that she’s taken home several older dogs herself. “Many shelters work hard to screen senior pets more thoroughly for conditions of aging, provide more extensive care to prepare them for adoption, and take pride in finding them homes,” she says, adding that these dogs often “provide fantastic companionship for quieter households, single people, and families.” (While you might be worried about high vet bills for seniors, it’s important for all dog owners to know that animals can surprise you at any age with expensive medical conditions—youth is no guarantee of good health.)</div>

                    <div class="card-body">Many shelters need volunteers to host dogs temporarily, which can both make space in the facility and also give those dogs a chance to show how they’ll behave in a home environment. “It can also provide an ‘out-of-the-shelter’ option for a dog that is not doing well in a shelter facility, or that has special behavioral or medical needs,” Berliner says, adding that many volunteers come to love fostering dogs. In the process, you might just find the dog you want to adopt permanently. Even if you’re not interested in fostering, many shelters will let you spend significant amounts of time with a dog you’re interested in.</div>

                    <div class="card-body">Don’t rely solely on your own instincts when you’re meeting dogs—staffers and volunteers at shelters and rescue organizations will have lots of information to share with you about their personalities, health, and behavior quirks. “Many shelters work hard to ask questions about adopter expectations and lifestyles and endeavor to match adopters with dogs that would seem to do well in their homes,” Berliner says. They’ll also have information about the dogs’ past situations and if they have lived in homes before (with previous owners or in foster care). Staffers might also have some idea about how they get along with kids and cats, and about whether they get anxious when left alone or bark when they’re stressed. Don’t hesitate to ask lots of questions.</div>

                    <div class="card-body">Animal shelters vaccinate the dogs that come in so they’re protected from diseases that can circulate around the facility. You’ll need to keep up with their shots once you bring them home (most dogs need boosters every year), but a dog adopted from a shelter should be ready to mingle with other pups in your neighborhood right away. “There are standards of care set out by the American Veterinary Medical Association and state laws that require what vaccinations shelter animals should receive—rabies vaccinations, especially,”</div>
